# Portfolio
* Welcome to my portfolio! 
* This is the very start of my professional portfolio...
  I am still learning so it will only improve from here!
*Enjoy.

# Bootcamp Challenge 2
* In this weeks challenge we had to create a portfolio for the course using only a blank code, and knowledge that we aquired from class.
* This code only uses html and css, but will have other elements once the course continues.
* Currently there are not any pieces of work since this is my first real project ever.
